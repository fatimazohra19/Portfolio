                    I am a Software Developer from Morocco, fluent in both English and French.
                </p>
                <p class="default-p">My journey into professional software development began with my passion for
                    problem-solving and a drive to create efficient solutions. This interest led me to pursue a strong
                    foundation in programming, culminating in my expertise in <span class="default-highlight">Java, Angular, and Spring Boot</span>.
                    Over the years, I’ve contributed to building dynamic, scalable, and user-friendly applications that make a difference.

                <p class="default-p">
                    Fast forward to today, I’ve had the privilege of collaborating with talented professionals in the tech industry.
                    My experience spans developing REST APIs, designing responsive front-end applications, managing databases,
                    and integrating complex systems. I’ve honed essential skills such as teamwork,
                    communication, and leadership while staying up to date with the latest technologies and best practices.

                <p class="default-p">
                    I’ve had the chance to code in <span class="default-highlight">several technologies</span> and also grow important <span class="default-highlight">soft skills</span>: I led transformative changes to improve team dynamics
                    and organizational culture inside a tech company. I have acquired coding knowledge while working with groups of
                    developers and studying documentation. I gained experience in programming logic,
                    enhanced software craftsmanship, <span class="default-highlight">developed websites</span>,
                    <span class="default-highlight">REST APIs</span>, built visual dashboards,
                    <span class="default-highlight">scrapers and crawlers</span>, and <span class="default-highlight">
                        retrieved and processed data</span> from various sources.

                <p class="default-p">
                    But that's on a professional side. On a personal note, other things about me include: I have a passion for <span class="default-highlight">
                    documentaries</span>, <span class="default-highlight">purpose-driven organizations</span>,
                    black coffee, engaging book stories, <span class="default-highlight">teamwork</span>,
                    <span class="default-highlight">science fiction and suspense movies</span> (they're the best!),
                    exploring new technologies, Linux, and the community experience. When travelling, I usually document my
                    <span class="default-highlight">whereabouts</span> and <span class="default-highlight">experiences</span>
                    so I can revisit them later.

                <p class="default-p">
                    I am continuously learning and adapting to new technologies and methodologies.
                    My goal is to create efficient, scalable, and user-friendly <span class="default-highlight">software
                    solutions that make a difference</span>. Whether it's front-end development, back-end services,
